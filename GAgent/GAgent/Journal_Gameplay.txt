Game loop like:
- Set initial conditions.  Choose and prep the team
- Run the event:
	- Events occur based on team composition, environment, and inventory
- Repeat

Mission types. Each of these triggered by agent traits and  agent/world conditions.
- Scouting
	- Find new agents
	- Find new quests
- Quest deployments.
- Base events.

Not all of the steps must be followed exatly, but this should give a general outline on how I would like to structure events.
Breaking down event flow:
	1. Agents are presented with a dramatic situation.  An issue requires resolution.
	2. Agents respond to the situation:
		a. Each has an emotional response to the situation.
		b. Each make a judgement call on the other agent's response.
	3. An action is taken to resolve the issue, by consensus or not.
	4. Memories, Judgements, and Emotional Responses resolved for each Agent.

Events:
- Promotion / Demotion

Gameplay concepts:
- I've already laid the groundwork for judgements and memories.  When agents are generated, they have a set of traits which will first be hidden.  When a (combination) of traits triggers
an event, this also reveals the trait.  The idea is so this works kinda like a scene in a story where characters get to know each other.
- This should provide a guide for creating events, because we have lists of traits which we can use as inspiration.

Combat:
The essence of balanced conflict is reading the strategy of your opponent correctly, and choosing a response.
- There should be many types of strats, some of which might branch
- For each strat, there should be multiple, perhaps branching, counters.
